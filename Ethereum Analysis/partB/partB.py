#Job 1 - Initial Aggregation

#To workout which services are the most popular, you will first have to aggregate transactions to see
#how much each address within the user space has been involved in. You will want to aggregate value for addresses in the to_address field.
#This, in essense, will be similar to the wordcount problem that we saw in Lab 1 and Lab 2.
#Job 2 - Joining transactions/contracts and filtering
#Once you have obtained this aggregate of the transactions, the next step is to perform a repartition join between this aggregate and contracts
# You will want to join the to_address field from the output of Job 1 with the address field of contracts .
#Secondly, in the reducer, if the address for a given aggregate from Job 1 was not present within contracts this should be filtered out as it is a user address and not a smart contract.
#Job 3 - Top Ten
#Finally, the third job will take as input the now filtered address aggregates and sort these via a top ten reducer, utilizing what you have learned from lab 4.
